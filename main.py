USAGE:
    python main.py [OPTIONS]

OPTIONS:
    -r, --replication_factor <int>...   Replication factor for dimensions (up to 3 values)
    -w, --water_per_ion <float>         Water per ion
    -o, --output_file <str>             Output file name (optional)

The main function is called with the following parameters:
    - replication: a tuple with the replication factor in x and y and z
    - al_mg_ratio: the Al/Mg ratio in the system
    - net_charge: the net charge of the system
    - water_per_ion: the number of water molecules per ion
    - output_file: the name of the output file (optional)
    - ff_atom_types: a list with the force field atom types
    - clay_sub_cutoff: the cutoff distance for clay substitution
    - random_seed: the seed for random number generation for mg substitution
    - water_distance: the distance between the clay and the water in Angstrom
    - mg_cutoff: the cutoff distance for Mg atoms for oxygen allocation in MT
    - h_cutoff: the cutoff distance for H atoms for oxygen allocation in MT
    - bond_cutoff: the cutoff distance for bonds
    - input_file: the name of the input unit cell file
    - ff_files: a list with the force field file paths
    - water_file: the name of the water model file

Note: 
    Adding a ff_param requires manually adding this allocation in SystemAllocator.py
    Adding ff parameters requires knowledge about the system and manually finding the correct type in the force field file(s)
    Impropers and torsions from CVFF have not been integrated yet
    Duplicate ff_types will be called "{ff_type}[dup]" for the second instance
    A manual check for the .data file is recommended to ensure that the correct parameters are allocated to the atoms

README.md contains more information about the parameters and the system generation process
