USAGE:
    python main.py <replication number>
    write the replication number as an integer
    if no replication number is provided, the default value is in this file

The main function is called with the following parameters:
    - file_name: the name of the input unit cell file
    - replication: a tuple with the replication factor in x and y
    - height: the height of the system in Angstrom
    - al_mg_ratio: the Al/Mg ratio in the system
    - ca_si_ratio: the Ca/Si ratio in the system
    - water_file: the name of the water model file
    - water_distance: the distance between the clay and the water in Angstrom
    - water_duplication: duplicates the szerba water box
    - water_per_ion: the number of water molecules per ion
    - ff_file_paths: a list with the force field file paths
    - mg_cutoff: the cutoff distance for Mg atoms for oxygen allocation in MT
    - h_cutoff: the cutoff distance for H atoms for oxygen allocation in MT
    - bond_cutoff: the cutoff distance for bonds
    - ff_params: a list with the force field parameters called ff_types

Note: 
    Adding a ff_param, requires to manually add this allocatoin in SystemAllocator.py
    Adding ff parameters requires knowledge about the system and manually finding the correct type in the force field file(s)
    Duplicate ff_types will be called "{ff_type}[dup]" for the second instance
    A manual check for the .data file is recommended to ensure that the correct parameters are allocated to the atoms
