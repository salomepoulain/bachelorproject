Progress:
- All classes and main structure is complete
- UnitCell.xyz file is read, along with ForceField.frc files
- Forcefield parameters and equivalents are being processed
- Data structures are completele and added.	

Remaining: 
- Add functions to allocate ff types and bond types [complecated !]
- Add solvate and ionize functions (maybe?)
- Add unit cell replication function
- Add write out file in outputs
		
Note:
